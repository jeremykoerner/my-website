<center><font size= "5">***Hi, I'm Jeremy.***</font></center> 
<br>
An aspiring data scientist, currently based in __*San Antonio, TX*__. While attending the University of Texas in San Antonio, I obtained my B.S.in Mathematics with a Minor in Statistics. I worked as a software Developer with HCL Technologies working with Java Back-end Development.

Intrigued by big data, obsessed with problem solving. Incredibly meticulous, and demand optimization. I work well on my own, and great within groups.

When circumstances allow it, I love to travel. My favorite trip was to Japan, and a highlight was visiting The Jigokudani monkey park near Nagano. I mainly want an excuse to post a picture of a macaque in a hotspring , so here's a reward for visiting my site.
